implement purchasable abilities but start the player with 999 money

3 guesses before game over

variable difficulty -- how many pre-filled

Equippable abilities per number
    or, maybe, a type of 'gem/socket' system
        that has the 'gem's in the numbers apply effects (like lightning damage) to the triggering ability

"one of these twoes is a dirty russian zed. find him before he escapes. do not let him know you are hunting him"
    no twoes can be "auto" revealed
    guesses in the same square, row, or column cause the hiding 2 to move to different place
    wrong guesses glow with greater intensity when nearer the zed
    
Antagonist hides bombs under certain #s
    You're told the digit that the bomb is planted under, but not which instance 

vines / fire that spreads from wrong guesses
    and obviously you lose if it saturates the board
    spread each 'turn' / guess, NOT real time

Challenge ideas:
    Turn timers
    Have to fill in #s in order (all 1s, then 2s, etc.)
    Must guess in order (first 1, then 2, etc.) 
    Cannot guess same wrong #s until they're right 
        If they run out of #s, game over
    Must fill in X last
    Render guessed #s invisible
    sudden death (no wrong guesses allowed)

Ability ideas:
    mark cells with even #s in square
    draws a random shape from cells and shows the total for that shape (may as well do tetriminos)
