Equippable abilities per number

$$$$

magic, spells, sci-fi -- cool orthoganal avenues
colors & elemental statuses
spy shit in the numbers, grids, sections? (missions to try to identify a particular one)

Challenge ideas:
Finish within x time
Reduce # of guesses
Have to fill in #s in order (all 1s, then 2s, etc.)
Must guess in order (first 1, then 2, etc.) 
Cannot guess same wrong #s until they're right 
    If they run out of #s, game over
Must fill in X last
Limited notes?
Render guessed #s invisible

freezing mechanic:
    (AI / antagonist) chosen square gets 'frozen'
    cells must be unfrozen individually
    by successfully guessing cells in same col / row
