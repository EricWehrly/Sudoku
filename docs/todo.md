sudoku meets minesweeper?

or battleship:
    pick out a specific linear combination of clustered numbers (eg '6, 2, 4')
    identify cluster as a target for the player
    let them use abilities to narrow the hunt quickly

variable difficulty -- how many pre-filled

Equippable abilities per letter

variable grid sizes and stuff

increased challenges and difficulties

Ability ideas:
(suffix) - (triggers) When all entries for # are found
(suffix) - (triggers) When guess is wrong
(suffix) - (triggers) When guess is correct
(Prefix) - Adds 1 hint
(Prefix) - Automatically fills in the most obvious cell
(Prefix) - Automatically fills in the least obvious cell
(Prefix) - Automatically make notes

magic, spells, sci-fi -- cool orthoganal avenues
colors & elemental statuses
spy shit in the numbers, grids, sections? (missions to try to identify a particular one)

Challenge ideas:
Finish within x time
Reduce # of guesses
Have to fill in #s in order (all 1s, then 2s, etc.)
Must fill in X last
Limited notes?
