Sudoku like billiards:
    Odds vs evens
    Computer goes first
    Player tries to guess evens before computer guesses odds
    (guess logic cannot work with more information than the player has)

sudoku meets minesweeper?

or battleship:
    pick out a specific linear combination of clustered numbers (eg '6, 2, 4')
    identify cluster as a target for the player
    let them use abilities to narrow the hunt quickly

Can your sudoku get "invaded"?
    Invader can block access to chosen squares,
    Which have to be unblocked (as cells) by guessing correctly a cell in the same row or column
